# How to Add Screenshots

To make your GitHub README look professional, follow these steps:

1.  Open your app in the browser (`http://localhost:5173`).
2.  Take a screenshot of the **Admin Dashboard** and save it as `admin_dashboard.png` in this `assets` folder.
3.  Take a screenshot of the **Customer Menu** and save it as `customer_view.png` in this `assets` folder.
4.  Commit and push these changes:
    
    ```bash
    git add assets/*
    git commit -m "Add project screenshots"
    git push origin main
    ```

Once done, the images will automatically appear in your README on GitHub!
